# BLT-Shop
An e-commerce app that let's clients buy a sandwich of their choosing. <br> We've: got promotions, specials, integration with Google Maps and most importantly - **panini** among many other sandwich kinds! <br><br>
Idea taken from: https://github.com/tedneward/ArchKatas <br>
## Full objective: 
```json
{
  "title" : "I'll Have the BLT",
  "description" : [
    "A national sandwich shop wants to enable \"fax in your order\" but over the Internet instead (in addition to their current fax-in service)",
    "Users: millions+",
    "Requirements: users will place their order, then be given a time to pick up their sandwich and directions to the shop (which must integrate with Google Maps); if the shop offers a delivery service, dispatch the driver with the sandwich to the user; mobile-device accessibility; offer national daily promotionals/specials; offer local daily promotionals/specials; accept payment online or in person/on delivery"
  ]
}
